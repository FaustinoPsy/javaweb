# Video Clipper
This is an assignment for Vilnius University's Java course.

# About the project
This is an Android application that can merge multiple videos. Furthermore, it can modify them.<br>
Clipper uses FFmpeg library and JNI to communicate with it. Also FFprobe, to fetch information about a specific file.

## Video Modifications (to be implemented)
Modifications planned at the moment are:
- Cropping
- Trimming
- Image overlay
- Background sounds
- Transitions between merged videos

## Other info
I am very open to receiving help for this open source project.
Suggestions and critic is also welcome, so contact me if you wish!
